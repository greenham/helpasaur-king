### Twitch Bot

- Support for per-channel configurations! ü•≥
  - Instead of just joining a static list of channels, the Twitch Bot will now join _users_ who have the bot active. üò≤
  - This opens up the ability for users to configure the bot specifically for their channel instead of being tied to the global defaults
  - The ability to change these values is not exposed _yet_, but will eventually be through chat commands as well as the web UI.
  - Users will **eventually** be able to control things like:
    - **Command prefix** _(free yourself from the shackles of `!`)_
    - **Enable/disable commands** _(if you just want the bot to shut up for a bit, but don't want to kick it out)_
    - **Enable/disable practice lists** _(still in BETA from 1.7.2, but will soon be opt-in for all!)_
    - **Enable/disable weekly race alerts** _(will post the race room link in your chat ~30 minutes before the weekly starts)_
  - This also resolves the issue of the bot being orphaned after username changes!
- `!pracrand` will no longer return the same room twice in a row as long as there are more than 2 items in the list

## 1.7.3

- Support search links with hash locations e.g. [https://helpasaur.com/commands#tutorial](https://helpasaur.com/commands#tutorial)

## 1.7.2

    - `!pracrand` -- supplies a random entry from the list
    - `!praclist` -- returns the entire list
    - `!pracdel <#>` -- deletes a specific entry in the list
    - `!pracclear` -- clears the entire list

## 1.7.1

## 1.7.0
