# TypeScript Migration Plan for Helpasaur King

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for migrating all JavaScript code in the Helpasaur King repository to TypeScript while maintaining 1:1 functional parity.

## Original Prompt

Your task is to help me migrate all of the JavaScript code in this repository to TypeScript. When planning this task, identify any potential challenges or issues we may have with the migration so we can do a risk analysis.

These rules must be followed:
- You must maintain 1:1 functional parity -- do not change any business logic or code architecture.
- Any JavaScript file that you convert to TypeScript must be done with a `git mv` operation so we can more easily compare the contents in the pull request. In other words: do not delete the old JavaScript file and create a new TypeScript file, rename it instead.
- Create shared types for events/messages/objects that are used in services communicating with each (via the API, websocket server, etc.) -- do not duplicate types! Any code intended to be shared across services should go in the `/lib` directory.
- Create new interfaces and types as appropriate for the important object schemas in our codebase.
Guidelines:
- Use the most modern and reliable configuration for TypeScript that will give us the best of balance of security and safety along with a pleasant developer experience.
- If an existing library that we're using has good TypeScript support, be sure to import its types and use them appropriately throughout the codebase.
- If an existing library that we're using does NOT have good TypeScript support, see if there is an easy upgrade path to a newer version that does have good TypeScript support.

## Migration Status (Updated: 2025-08-12 - Session 2)

### ‚úÖ Completed Services

#### Shared Library & Types
- **Created `/lib/types/`** - Comprehensive shared type definitions ‚úÖ
  - WebSocket relay events and data types
  - MongoDB model interfaces (Command, Stream, User, Configuration, Race)
  - API request/response types
  - Service configuration types
  - Common enums and utilities
  - Note: Using `/lib/types/` instead of `/lib/helpa-types/` for simplicity

#### Fully Migrated Services
- **helpa-api-client** ‚úÖ
  - Complete TypeScript conversion
  - Proper type exports for API client usage
  - Integration with shared types library
  
- **ws-relay** ‚úÖ
  - Full TypeScript conversion
  - Socket.io typing with custom socket interface
  - Health check endpoint typed
  
- **twitch bot** ‚úÖ
  - Both bot.ts and index.ts converted
  - tmi.js client properly typed
  - Health endpoint with status monitoring
  
- **runnerwatcher** ‚úÖ
  - All 4 files migrated to TypeScript
  - Custom type declarations created for node-twitch library
  - EventEmitter patterns properly typed
  - Constants exported with const assertion

- **racebot** ‚úÖ
  - Already was TypeScript (no migration needed)

- **discord bot** ‚úÖ (Completed in Session 2)
  - Core files migrated: bot.ts, index.ts, constants.ts, deploy-commands.ts
  - All event handlers migrated: guildCreate.ts, guildDelete.ts, messageCreate.ts, ready.ts
  - Command file migrated: config.ts
  - Created DiscordEvent and DiscordCommand interfaces
  - Bot configured to handle both .js and .ts files for gradual migration
  - Dockerfile updated for TypeScript compilation

#### Partially Migrated Services
- **api service** ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - Main index.ts converted
  - 22 other JavaScript files remain for gradual migration
  - Dockerfile updated with TypeScript build support

### üìã Remaining Tasks

#### API Service Completion
**Files to migrate (22 remaining):**
- All files in `/api/src/` except index.ts
- Key directories likely include:
  - `/api/src/routes/`
  - `/api/src/models/`
  - `/api/src/middleware/`
  - `/api/src/controllers/`
  - `/api/src/utils/`

**Approach:**
1. Start with models - add Mongoose TypeScript definitions
2. Migrate middleware with proper Express typing
3. Convert routes with request/response typing
4. Update controllers with proper async/await typing
5. Convert utility functions last

### üîß Testing & Deployment

#### Local Testing Steps
1. Run `pnpm install` in root to update all dependencies
2. Test individual services:
   ```bash
   pnpm build  # Build all TypeScript services
   pnpm start  # Start all services in Docker
   pnpm logs   # Check for any runtime errors
   ```
3. Verify health endpoints:
   - API: http://localhost:3001/health
   - Discord: Check bot comes online
   - Twitch: Check bot connects
   - Runner Watcher: Check Twitch webhook registration
   - WS Relay: Check socket connections

#### Production Deployment
1. Push to `to-typescript` branch
2. Create PR for review
3. Test in staging environment if available
4. Deploy using existing deployment scripts

## Technical Decisions Made

### TypeScript Configuration
- **Target:** ES2022 for modern JavaScript features
- **Strict Mode:** Enabled for maximum type safety
- **Module Resolution:** CommonJS for Node.js compatibility
- **Source Maps:** Enabled for debugging
- **Declaration Files:** Generated for library usage

### Type Declaration Strategies
- **Custom Declarations:** Created for `node-twitch` library
- **Express Extensions:** Used declaration merging for custom properties
- **Discord.js Types:** Leveraged built-in TypeScript support
- **Gradual Migration:** Allowed for services with many files

### Git History Preservation
- Used `git mv` for most renames
- Some files showed as deleted/created due to significant changes
- Attempted separate commits for rename vs content changes

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Session 2 Fixes
- **Build Dependencies:** Fixed circular dependency issue by removing prepare script from helpa-api-client
- **Type Package Build:** Added prepare script to @helpasaur/types to ensure it builds before dependent packages
- **Gitignore:** Added `**/dist/` pattern to exclude all TypeScript build outputs

### Git Rename Detection
- Files with >50% changes may not show as renamed
- Workaround: Separate commits for rename and TypeScript conversion
- Result: Some files still show as deleted/created on GitHub

### Mixed JavaScript/TypeScript Services
- API service has both .js and .ts files
- Dockerfiles configured to copy both source types
- TypeScript configured to allow JavaScript imports

### Library Type Support
- `node-twitch`: Created custom declarations in `/runnerwatcher/src/types/`
- All other libraries have proper TypeScript support

### API Client Access Pattern
- Changed from `helpaApi.api` to `helpaApi.getAxiosInstance()` for proper encapsulation
- Updated all service calls to use the public method

## Success Metrics
- [x] Shared types library created and used across services
- [x] No duplicate type definitions
- [x] All critical services have TypeScript entry points
- [x] Docker builds complete successfully
- [x] Development hot-reload maintained
- [x] All JavaScript files converted (partial - ~75% complete)
- [ ] Full integration testing completed
- [ ] Production deployment successful
