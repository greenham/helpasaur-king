tourney,tournament|The 2018 ALttP NMG Tournament is currently in Groups Stages. Follow the results here: http://challonge.com/ALTTP2018/ and watch matches on the SpeedGaming network.

1.0,jp,jp1.0|Japanese 1.0 is the version of ALttP most commonly used for speedrunning since the Japanese version contains less text (saves ~1 minute in NMG), and a few minor glitches like fake flippers, item dash, superspeed, and block-erase only exist in version 1.0 (saves ~30-40s in NMG).

ad|AD is a common abbreviation for the All Dungeons category, which allows some major glitches like Out of Bounds, but bans Exploration Glitch, Door Glitches, and Wrong Warps. See: adtas, adtut, and bombclips for more info.

airpumping,airpump|A technique to optimize Link's walking patterns. When walking diagonally to the north or west and at an angle of less than 45 degrees, you can mash diagonals into the air to boost pixels. Like wallpumping, this is merely a frame-saving technique in most instances, due to human limitations on mashing.

antipumping,antipump|When walking east or south, Link's movement begins on the 1 pixel per frame speed of his animation. This means you do not want to reset his walking speed by wallpumping, airpumping, or stairpumping. You always want to avoid altering your input while moving south or east, as any change can slow Link down by resetting the movement sequence. Generally speaking, if you're moving south or east, you want to minimize the number of inputs you use to do so.

bb|Blue balls (bb) refers to an attack Agahnim makes. This attack is undesired since it can't be repelled back at him, unlike the yellow ball (yb) attack. The first Agahnim fight consists of repeating cycles of the following five attacks: 1.[yb] 2.[yb or bb] 3.[yb or bb] 4.[yb or bb] 5.[lightning]. Agahnim is defated after being hit by 6 yellow balls.

oob|Out of Bounds (abbreviated OoB) means leaving the intended confinements of the playing field. The most powerful/broken Out of Bounds state is EG (Exploration Glitch).

pumping,pump|Pumping is a small movement optimization technique which saves ~10s over an Any% NMG run. There are several types (see: airpumping, stairpumping, wallpumping), but all involve attempting to reset Link's normal movement pattern such that more pixels are gained per frame. The most beneficial types of pumping are double pumping (in one-tile wide spots where Link has walls on either side) and pumping in shallow water.

rbo|Reverse Boss Order is a category in which you defeat all bosses in the reverse order, all the way from Ganon to Armos Knights. The run ends, as usual, when collecting the Triforce. The category requires frequent use of major glitches such as EG and YBA.

s+q,sq,snq,s&q|S+Q means Save and Quit and can be used to minimize overworld travel. With so many other categories that allow heavy sequence breaking, the community at large has decided to not allow S+Q in an NMG speedrun simply to include more content of the game that most other categories skip.

somaria|Somaria Glitches Tutorial by SuperSKUJ: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfP3jF4sdIY

spindash,spinspeed|By releasing a sword spin and pressing the A-button the first frame after release, Link will be put into a glitched state and cannot use his sword. If you touch manual stairs and exit cardinally, Link will move at dashing speed with the ability to change directions. Just as with hookdash, pressing A, taking damage, changing screen, or jumping off a ledge will end the glitched state. JP v1.0 only.

srcguides|http://www.speedrun.com/alttp/guides

stairlag|When exiting a staircase, Link will walk in place for a short period of time unless you hold LEFT or RIGHT during the first frame or 2 (depending on directions) after the stairwell animation.

stairpumping,stairpump|While walking on a staircase or ladder in which you still retain control of Link's movement, you can pump diagonals when walking north on them. The normal animation for climbing stairs/ladders contains a lot of 0 pixel per frame movement, so pumping these ladders to avoid such frames is very important. Even if you do no other pumping, you should incorporate stairpumping into your movement, since it saves more than just a handful of frames.

subpixel,subpixels|This game uses subpixels for its movement. This is how Link gets the movement speed of 2-1-2-1 on normal ground etc. More info: https://alttp-wiki.net/index.php/Subpixels

superspeed|By having a medallion or hookshot equipped and hitting the Y-button and the A-button at the same frame (or using a spindash), you activate a glitched walking state. By climbing stairs that you can manually move up and down and exiting them cardinally, you will gain dash speed while walking. This activated state is called superspeed. The effect is active until canceled by pressing the A-button, taking damage, changing screen, or jumping off a ledge. JP v1.0 only. Tutorial by SuperSKUJ: https://youtu.be/Pvmi5DuR9rA

swamp|Room-by-room Swamp Tutorial by BluntBunny: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/170635873?t=01h18m48s

swordbuffer|Sword Buffering is performed by pressing a direction and pressing B the next frame. Since using your sword will interrupt all D-Pad inputs it allows you to hold the dpad for longer than 1 frame but you move for only 1 frame if executed properly.

swordclimb|By holding out the sword first then performing a hookdash (itemdash with hookshot) on stairs you will be able to climb the stairs with the same speed as walking whilst holding out the sword on flat ground. If the sword spin is released before exiting the stairs, you will also have superspeed afterwards. JP v1.0 only.

treerupees|An alternate rupee route for Any% NMG which skips the chests behind Saha in favor of pulling 2 trees. Done well, this route only saves ~5-6 seconds over Saha rupees. More info: https://alttp-wiki.net/index.php/Agahnim%27s_Tower#Rupee_tree

version,1.0cart|The best way to verify a 1.0 cart is to try one of the 1.0-specific glitches such as item-dashing or fake flippers. Genuine 1.0 carts will have a 2-digit number on the back. Letters indicate patched versions (A=1.1, B=1.2).

wallpumping,wallpump|A technique that optimizes Link's walking pattern. When walking cardinally to the west or north, Link's movement begins on the 2 pixel speed, and changes to the directional input will reset his movement speed back to the beginning of the sequence. Therefore, if walking north or west along a wall, you can mash diagonals into the wall to repeatedly reset Link's movement to the 2 pixel speed and avoid the slower 1 pixel speed in the sequence.

Different locations and potions can have different effects such as screen warps or accessing the flute menu without actually having the flute (even in the dark world).
