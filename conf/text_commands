pumping|MASHING THE BUTTONS IS CALLED PUMPING

1.0|Japanese 1.0 is the version of ALttP most commonly used for speedrunning since the Japanese version contains less text (saves ~1 minute), and a few minor glitches like fake flippers, item dash, and superspeed only exist in version 1.0 (saves ~30-40s). The best way to verify a 1.0 cart is to try one of the 1.0-specific glitches mentioned. Genuine 1.0 carts will have a 2-digit number on the back. Letters indicate patched versions (A=1.1, B=1.2).

airpumping|Another technique to optimize Link's walking patterns. When walking diagonally to the north or west and at an angle of less than 45 degrees, you can mash diagonals into the air to boost pixels. Like wallpumping, this is a frame-saving technique in most instances, due to human limitations on mashing.

antipumping|When walking east or south, Link's movement begins on the 1 pixel per frame speed of his animation. This means you do not want to reset his walking speed by wallpumping, airpumping, or stairpumping. But this even has more implications than that: you always want to avoid altering your input while moving south or east, as any alteration can slow Link down by resetting the movement sequence. Generally speaking, if you're moving south or east, you want to minimize the number of inputs you use to do so.

bb|Blue balls (bb) refers to an attack Agahnim makes. This attack is undesired since it can't be repelled back at him, unlike the yellow ball (yb) attack. The first Agahnim fight consists of repeating cycles of the following five attacks: 1.[yb] 2.[yb or bb] 3.[yb or bb] 4.[yb or bb] 5.[lightning]. Agahnim is defated after being hit by 6 yellow balls.

It is possible to defeat Ganon with only the Master Sword but requires a beefy 52 spins (Master Sword slashes do not damage Ganon).

rbo|Reverse Boss Order is a category in which you defeat all bosses in the reverse order, all the way from Ganon to Armos Knight. The run ends, as usual, when collecting the Triforce. The category requires frequent use of larger glitches such as EG and YBA.

s+q|S+Q means Save and Quit and can be used to minimize overworld travel. With so many other categories that allow heavy sequence breaking, the community at large has decided to not allow S+Q in an NMG speedrun simply to include more content of the game that most other categories skip.

spindash|By releasing a sword spin and pressing the A-button the first frame after release, Link will be put into a glitched state and cannot use his sword. If you touch manual stairs and exit cardinally, Link will move at dashing speed with the ability to change directions. Just as with hookdash, pressing A, taking damage, changing screen, or jumping off a ledge will end the glitched state. JP v1.0 only.

srcguides|http://www.speedrun.com/alttp/guides

stairlag|When exiting a staircase, Link will walk in place for a short period of time unless you hold LEFT or RIGHT during the first frame or 2 (depending on directions) after the stairwell animation.

stairpumping|While walking on a staircase or ladder in which you still retain control of Link's movement, you can pump diagonals when walking north on them. The normal animation for climbing stairs/ladders contains a lot of 0 pixel per frame movement, so pumping these ladders to avoid such frames is very important. Even if you do no other pumping, you should incorporate stairpumping into your movement, since it saves more than just a handful of frames.

superspeed|By having a medallion or hookshot equipped and hitting the Y-button and the A-button at the same frame (or using a spindash), you activate a glitched walking state. By climbing stairs that you can manually move up and down and exiting them cardinally, you will gain dash speed while walking. This activated state is called superspeed. The effect is active until canceled by pressing the A-button, taking damage, changing screen, or jumping off a ledge. JP v1.0 only. Tutorial by SuperSKUJ: https://youtu.be/Pvmi5DuR9rA

swordbuffer|Sword Buffering is performed by pressing a direction and pressing B the next frame. Since using your sword will interrupt all D-Pad inputs it allows you to hold the dpad for longer than 1 frame but you move for only 1 frame if executed properly.

swordclimb|By holding out the sword first then performing a hookdash (itemdash with hookshot) on stairs you will be able to climb the stairs with the same speed as walking whilst holding out the sword on flat ground. If the sword spin is released before exiting the stairs, you will also have superspeed afterwards. JP v1.0 only.

wallpumping|A technique that optimizes Link's walking pattern. When walking cardinally to the west or north, Link's movement begins on the 2 pixel speed, and changes to the directional input will reset his movement speed back to the beginning of the sequence. Therefore, if walking north or west along a wall, you can mash diagonals into the wall to repeatedly reset Link's movement to the 2 pixel speed and avoid the slower 1 pixel speed in the sequence.
